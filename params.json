No localization supported.\r\n2. Not *easy* for ppl who're not familiar with Git, markdown, html.\r\n3. For people who only cares about content, the process like setting up requirement, sending pull request, solve merge conflict, etc. might be an overhead.\r\n\r\n### Samples\r\n[Sample page for user or organization](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/sites)  \r\n[Sample page for project introduction](http://dragonbones.effecthub.com/)  \r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nYou are already seeing the demo for project introduction!  \r\n[Click here to see product details](http://norliu.github.io/testpage.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
